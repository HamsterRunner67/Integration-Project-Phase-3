# Integration Project Phase 3 - Minesweeper
The final part of the integration project, with code following the PEP 8 standards.
I made the game Minesweeper that can be played inside the console.

How To Play (Also Stated Inside Game):

In Minesweeper the objective is to flag all the bombs that are found on the map. When a point is selected it tells you the amount of bombs that are in a 3 x 3 area around the spot. If you hit a bomb you lose and if you flag all the mines you win. The top left is the origin of the grid and it goes X coord first and then Y coord. For example to select the middle of a 10x10grid you would type s 5 5 and to flag it you type f 5 5. Once you flag a point you can un-flag the point at anytime.
